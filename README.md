## What is Tab Story?

Tab Story helps you organize and manage your browser tabs by automatically grouping them based on your browsing intent. Using Chrome's built-in AI, it analyzes your tabs and creates meaningful groups like "Job Search," "Learning," "Shopping," etc., making it easy to track and restore your browsing sessions.

## Key Features

- **Smart Tab Grouping** - AI automatically organizes tabs by intent and topic
- **Intent Detection** - Captures what you're working on and groups related tabs together
- **AI Summaries** - Generate quick summaries of any webpage with Chrome's built-in AI
- **Timeline View** - Track your browsing history organized by time and intent
- **Search** - Find any tab instantly by searching titles, notes, or intent
- **Auto-Backup** - Automatically saves your tab groups so you never lose your work
- **Privacy First** - All AI processing happens locally on your device

## How to Use

1. **Open the side panel** - Click the Tab Story icon in your Chrome toolbar

2. **Create an intent** - Click "New Intent" and describe what you're working on (e.g., "Job Search", "Learning React")

3. **Organize tabs** - Tab Story automatically groups your tabs by intent

4. **Get AI summaries** - Click any tab group and use "AI Summary" to get a quick overview

5. **View timeline** - Click the timeline icon to see your browsing history organized by time

6. **Search** - Use the search bar to find any tab, note, or intent quickly

## What Tab Story Does

Tab Story solves the problem of tab overload. Instead of having dozens of random tabs open, it:

- **Captures your intent** when you start browsing
- **Groups related tabs** automatically
- **Tracks your browsing timeline** so you can see what you worked on and when
- **Generates AI summaries** to help you quickly understand content
- **Backs up your sessions** so you can restore them later
- **Keeps everything private** by processing data locally on your device

## Storage Management

Tab Story includes built-in storage management tools:
- View storage usage by category (tab groups, backups, etc.)
- Clean old backups to free up space
- Remove deleted tabs from storage
- All data is stored locally using Chrome's storage API

## Technology

- Pure JavaScript with no external dependencies
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- Chrome Built-in AI APIs for local, privacy-first processing
- Gemini API fallback for extended compatibility

## Privacy

- **100% local processing** - Chrome's built-in AI means your data never leaves your device
- **No tracking** - We don't collect or transmit any user data
- **No analytics** - Your browsing habits stay private
- **Open source** - Full transparency of what the extension does
